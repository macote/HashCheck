FAQ
---

### Why MinGW?

I wanted to have an executable having the least runtime dependencies possible.

### Why FileStream?

MinGW's fstream can't open WCHAR filenames and I was not interested in changing fstream's implementation.

### What's the coding style?

The coding style is inspired from Google C++ [coding style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html "Google C++ Style Guide").
